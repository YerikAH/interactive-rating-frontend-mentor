# Frontend Mentor | Interactive rating solution

This is a solution to the  Interactiverating component. The challenge is from [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub/interactive-rating-component-zihZ3c_mwQ).


## Challenge consists of


1. Select and submit a number rating
1. See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
1. See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## What I learned

Another challenge completed, I was going to develop it only with React, but decided to try another flavor, React + Typescript, at first it was difficult, there were many bugs, but I managed to fix them, I will use more React with Typescript in some projects.

## Technologies used in the project
- React
- CSS
- styled-components
- Typescript
- Vite
